# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Can we tell when someone will get heart disease? This research achieves this goal with up to 91% accuracy by using machine learning models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and KNN in conjunction with actual health data.  
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using health survey data and machine learning models. It demonstrates how data science can contribute to early diagnosis and better health outcomes.


## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: `heart_2020_cleaned.csv`
- **Size**: ~320,000 records
- **Features**: BMI, Smoking, AlcoholDrinking, Stroke, PhysicalActivity, Diabetic, GenHealth, AgeCategory, and more.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and ML models
- XGBoost for advanced gradient boosting


## 📊 ML Models Applied
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost Classifier

### 🏆 Best Performance
- **XGBoost** achieved **91.35% accuracy**.



## 📈 Key Visualizations
- Scatter plot: BMI vs PhysicalHealth (colored by Heart Disease)
- Histograms: Distribution of health features
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report for each model
